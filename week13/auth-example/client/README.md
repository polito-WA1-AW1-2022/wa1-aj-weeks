# `react-scores-mini` project

This project contains a _minimal_ example of a React application for recording the scores you got with your exams.

It will be developed in phases, in several weeks, to illustrate the different features of React.

* _Phase 1_: just static component rendering, and props-propagation. Uses 'fake' data and does not allow any user interaction.
* ~~_Phase 2_: data manipulation with a form.~~
* ~~_Phase 3_: implementing routes using React Router v6.~~
  * ~~_Phase 3.3_: restoring the edit exam functionality through a Location State (nested and dynamic routing were removed).~~
* _Phase 4_: interacting with APIs.
* _Phase 5_: authentication.
